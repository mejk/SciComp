<p>Computational chemistry and physics are relatively young fields - easy to understand since the first digital (in contrast to mechanical) computers were developed in the late 1930’s. The first programmable computer, the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z1_(computer)">Z1</a>, was developed by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a> in Germany in the late 1930’s. The early developments in programmable digital computers were largely driven by military applications in 1940’s and 1950’s. The earliest computers were not reliable or stable, or were built more as calculators for a single purpose. ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) that was built in 1946 is often said to be the first real computer. Transistors did not exist at that time and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a> (in Philadelphia) had 17,480 vacuum tubes. Its original purpose was to determine trajectories for ballistic missiles, but due to the war ending it was used to study nuclear reactions. Nuclear warhead and storage related simulations are still one of the main uses of the largest supercomputers. One additional notable aspect of ENIAC is that, unlike modern computers, it was not able to store programs. ENIAC was followed by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANIAC_I">MANIAC I</a> (Mathematical Analyzer Numerical Integrator And Computer Model I at Los Alamos) and it was used in the landmark paper “<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1063%2F1.1699114">Equations of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines</a>”, J. Chem. Phys. 21: 1087–1092 (1953) by Metropolis et al. that introuced the Metropolis Monte Carlo method, one of the most used and important algorithms even today. MANIAC was also used in the development of the hydrogen bomb. Generalization of the Metropolis Monte Carlo method is known as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo and it is important in optimization and machine learning. On pure chemistry side, the earliest papers appeared in the 1960’s and the term computational chemistry was (probably; hard to trace) first used in 1970’s.</p>
<p>Independent if one talks about physics, chemistry or some other field, the development can be divided roughly in the theoretical developments in the field, developments of numerical methods and algorithms and hardware. The development of numerical methods cannot be over-emphasized as it is critical to be able to model and simulate larger systems and for longer times. This will become clear as we discuss various methods and how they scale in terms of the number of degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>Currently, fields such as hybrid methods that combine quantum mechanical and classical molecular dynamics and coarse-grained methods have gained a lot of popularity. Methods that combine different time and/or length scales can in general be called <em><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiscale_modeling">multiscale methods</a></em> and this will be discussed in more detail later. The methods that go under the term <em><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a></em> and perhaps the most rapidly growing family of methods and they are applied in almost all imaginable fields. Machine learning is not a simulation method as such, but rather it is a class of methods that allows classification (clustering) of data, analysis and model building. Machine learning methods rely heavily on statistics, linear algebra and stochastic methods such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov processes</a>. We will discuss such methods later.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-computational-chemistry">
<h2>What is computational chemistry?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-computational-chemistry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is difficult to define what exactly computational chemistry is or is not. Wikipedia defines quite broadly (and one could say adeqately) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
"Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of theoretical chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion (dihydrogen cation, see references therein for more details), the quantum many-body problem cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form. While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical experiments, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical phenomena. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials. "    
</blockquote>    
<p>Although the field of computational chemistry didn’t exist in the 1830’s, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Comte">Auguste Comte</a>, the philosopher behind <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism">positivism</a>, stated that it is impossible and destructive to try to study chemistry using mathematics (and as an extrapolation by computers):</p>
<blockquote>
"Every attempt to employ mathematical methods in the study of chemical
questions must be considered profoundly irrational and contrary to the
spirit of chemistry.... if mathematical analysis should ever hold a
prominent place in chemistry - an aberration which is happily almost
impossible - it would occasion a rapid and widespread degeneration of that
    science."<p></p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -Auguste Comte, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31881">Cours de philosophie positive</a>, 1830
</blockquote>    
<p>This view is, if course, very fitting with the idea of positivisim and completely (or ‘<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong">not even wrong</a>’) in terms of science. It is also somewhat curious given that in Comte’s own hierarchy of sciences, mathematics was the most fundamental meaning that all the other sciences use it.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to provide a strict defintion or classification as what computational chemistry is, let’s rather list methods and approaches use by computational chemists - after all computational chemistry includes various simulation techniques, structural analysis, using computers to design or predict new molecules or/and molecular binding, and data mining from experimental and/or computational results. It is also hard - and unnecessary - to draw strict defintion between computational chemistry, physics or, say, chemical engineering or pharmacy/drug design. Although these fields all have their own special characteristics, from the computational perspective they share the same methods and methodologies many of them, especially when it come to algorithms and computational techniques, come from applied mathematics and computer science. Right now, we restrict ourselves just to provide and a list and we will discuss some of them in detail later. For most part here, we focus on simulation and we will also discuss some analysis and machine learning techniques. What is also common to the computational disciplines is that one needs in-depth knowledge across traditional disciplines.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Quantum mechanical methods: <em>ab initio</em> methods, density functional theory, Car-Parrinello simulations</p></li>
<li><p>Classical molecular dynamics, steered molecular dynamics, non-equilibrium molecular dynamics</p></li>
<li><p>Coarse-grained molecular dynamics</p></li>
<li><p>Lattice-Boltzmann simulations</p></li>
<li><p>Phase field simulations</p></li>
<li><p>Finite element methods</p></li>
<li><p>Monte Carlo techniques</p></li>
<li><p>Optimization techniques</p></li>
<li><p>Machine learning methods, Bayesian techniques, Markov models, deep learning</p></li>
<li><p>Free energy calculations</p></li>
</ul>
<p>… and the list goes on. This (by necessity incomplete) list aims to convey the idea that the field is very broad with no clear boundries.</p>

<h2>Nobel Prizes to Computational Chemistry: 1998 and 2013<a class="headerlink" href="#nobel-prizes-to-computational-chemistry-1998-and-2013" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To date, the Nobel Prize is Chemistry has been awarded twice to computational chemists. The first one was <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1998/summary/">1998</a>, when
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kohn">Walter Kohn</a> (see also his <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1998/kohn/biographical/">biographical notes</a>), “for his development of the density-functional theory”, and John A. Pople (see also his <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1998/pople/biographical/">biographical notes</a>) , “for his development of computational methods in quantum chemistry”, were the recipients. Kohn was born in Austria, escaped the nazis to Canada and received his BSc in Applied Mathematics at the University of Toronto. He moved to study physics at Harvard for his PhD. His PhD supervisor was <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger">Julian Schwinger</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/summary/">1965 Nobel Laureate in Physics</a>. He was at the University of California in Santa Barbara at the time of his Prize. Kohn passed away in 2016 at the age of 93. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pople">Sir John Pople</a> received his PhD in Mathematics from Cambridge. He was at Northwestern University at the time of the Nobel Prize. He passed away in 2004 at the age of 2004. Pople is one of the authors of the first version of the software suite Gaussian. Pople’s PhD supervisor was <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennard-Jones">Sir John Lennard-Jones</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential">Lennard-Jones potential</a> used in almost all classical classical molecular dynamics simulations is named after him.</p>
<p>The second Nobel Prize to computational chemistry came in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2013/summary/">2013</a> when it was awarded to Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel “for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems.” The press release of the Royal Academy of Science stated the importance of computational chemistry very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
"Today the computer is just as important a tool for  chemists as the test tube. Simulations are so realistic that they predict the outcome of traditional experiments." 
<p></p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/press-22.pdf">Pressmeddelande, Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien</a>
</blockquote>    
<p>Like Kohn, Martin Karplus was born in Vienna, Austria and moved to the USA to escape the nazis. He did his PhD in chemistry at Caltech with the two-time Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling. He is the originator of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.charmm.org/">CHARMM</a> molecular simulation package. Karplus was at Université de Strasbourg and Harvard at the time of the Prize. Arieh Warshel was postdoc with Karplus’ at Harvard in Chemical Physics. He went to the Weizmann Institute in Isreal for a faculty job but moved lated to the University of Southern California after <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4438751,00.html">Weizmann didn’t grant him tenure</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levitt">Michael Levitt</a> was born in Pretoria, South Africa and he did his PhD in Biophysics at Cambridge. At the time of the Prize he was at Stanford where he is a professor of Structural Biology. As a side note on tenure and Nobel Prizes, Nobel winners that were not given tenure include at least <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Sargent">Tom Sargent</a> (Economics 2011; University of Pennsylvania didn’t give tenure), <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Onsager">Lars Onsager</a> (Chemistry 1968; dismissed/let go by John’s Hopkins and Brown universities)</p>

<h3>Experiments and <em>in silico</em> modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#experiments-and-in-silico-modeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Computational microscope.</strong> The term <em>computational microscope</em> was probably introduced first by Walker and Mezey in 1995 in their article “A new computational microscope for molecules: High resolution MEDLA images of taxol and HIV-1 protease, using additive electron density fragmentation principles and fuzzy set methods”. This combined imagining and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The term was then re-introduced in the context of MD simulations by Lee et al. in their 2009 article “Discovery Through the Computational Microscope”. The analogy is a very good one: molecular simulations can mimic behvior of systems in the atomic scale and they allow one to see, analyze and track the atoms. Lee et al. conclude their article by saying</p>
<blockquote><em>
Overall, simulations can cast light on the basic architectural principles of molecules that explain fundamental cellular mechanics and might eventually direct the design of proteins with desired mechanical properties. Most importantly, beyond the understanding gained regarding the molecular mechanisms of force-bearing proteins, these examples serve to demonstrate that incessant advancements of MD methodology bring about discoveries stemming from simulation rather than from experiment. Molecular modeling, while useful as a means to complement many experimental methodologies, is rapidly becoming a tool for making accurate predictions and, thereby, discoveries that stand on their own. In other words, it is becoming a computational microscope.    
    </em>
    </blockquote>    
<p>This summarizes the situation very well. Although computation has finally gained the recognition as an independent paradigm of research with theory and experiments, every now and then one still hears the comment <em>but it is just a simulation</em> or <em>it is just a model</em>. While that can be politely dismissed, such an ignorant comment deserves an equally polemic answer: <em>utter rubbish from a petrified mind.</em> Independent if one is a theorist, experimentalist or computational scientist, it is imperative to have a reasonable understanding what the other methods of research can and cannot do.</p>

<h3>Simulations: The 3rd paradigm of research<a class="headerlink" href="#simulations-the-3rd-paradigm-of-research" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the above potentially provoking statements, it is important to keep in mind that while we are dealing with <em>empirical sciences</em> and any prediction has to be proven by experiments, theory and computation provide predictions and explanations for observations in a manner that is often impossible for experimentation alone. In addition, experiments have their own problems and to get a signal out of any system, one must poke it, that is, one has to perturb the system to get a response. Simulations don’t have such a limitation but can actually be used to study what the effects of probes or peturbations are on a given system. All in all, experiments, theory and simulations all have their advantages and problems and one should not consider any of them to be more superior than the others. With the rise of big data, one could even extend the methods of research to <em>data-intensive analysis</em>.</p>

<h2>Dangers<a class="headerlink" href="#dangers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The biggest problem of any computational modeling is the user, the computer will do what it is told to do.</p>
<p>We have stated in our paper “The good, the bad and the user in soft matter simulations”:</p>
<blockquote><em>
It may sound absurd and somewhat provoking, but available simulation 
software (i.e., not home grown programs) becoming very user friendly and easy to 
obtain can almost be seen as a negative development!
    </em>
    </blockquote>
<p>Not that long ago all simulations were based on house-written programs. Such programs had obvious limitations: They were not available to others, the codes were not maintained for longer periods of time, they were often difficult to use for all but the person who wrote code. It was also difficult to improve their performance due to very limited number (often one) developers. Modern codes such as Gromacs, NAMD, LAMMPS and such in the field of molecular simulations, are well maintained, have long-term stability, extensive error checking due to large number of users and they offer excellent performance that is impossible reach for any individual developer or even a small group. They are also very easy to use.</p>
<p>Similarly to experiments, it is easy train a person to use the software and even produce data using the built in analysis methods. That is, however, a precarious path. It is absolutey imperative to have a very strong background in the application field and its underlying theories and methods to be able to produce something meaningful. One should never use a software package as a black box!</p>

<p>Just like with experiments, there is no single correct choice for a method. Choosing the most appropriate method for the task at hand depends on various issues. First and foremost, what is the phenomenon/phenomena that is being studied. For example, if one is interested in the behavior of electrons, then quantum mechanical methods are the obvious candidates. This immediately brings in additional questions such as are we interested in band structure, chemical reactions, excited states or something else. Such questions are very important since they again narrow down the choice of methods. For example, if one is studied excited states, the usual methods from density functional theory are not enough. On the other hand, if one is interested in formation of micelles or diffusion of molecules, quantum mechanical methods are useless and the more reasonable choices would be classical MD or coarse-grained MD. Why? Collective phenomena such aggregate formation doesn’t  depends directly on quantum mechanical properties (although some of them are implicitly integrated in the higher level models such as classical MD). One may also be interested in static or dynamic phenomena. In the former case, optimization methods may be method of choice whereas in the latter case one needs an equation of motion that is integrated in time.</p>

<p><strong>Mesoscale:</strong> Intermediate scales that are not quite observable directly by eye, but typically accessible by many experimental techniques. This is a very broad concept.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<h3>Hybrid models<a class="headerlink" href="#hybrid-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Figure lists some common models. It is important to notice that it is possible to combine, or hybridize them. The most common hybridization is perhaps the QM/MM methods, that is, combination of a quantum mechanical  method with a method from the classical MD level; the acronym MM stands for molecular mechanics and it is often used synonymously with classical MD. The principle is simple: In QM/MM, a small part of the system is treated using quantum mechanics and the rest with classical (Newtonian) mechanics. Although the idea is simple, there are many complications and limitations.</p>
<p>Similarly to QM/MM, it is possible combine classical MD and coarse-grained MD. Another fairly common combination is lattice-Boltzmann (LB) and molecular dynamics. There, the difficulties are different since the lattice-Boltzmann method uses a grid to solve fluid motion using densities (=no explicit particles), but classical MD brings in particles. This means that the two must coupled in consistent way. Often that means using composite particles instead of ‘normal’ atoms.</p>

<div class="section" id="implicit-vs-explicit-water">
<h3>Implicit vs explicit water<a class="headerlink" href="#implicit-vs-explicit-water" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Water is present in all biomolecular systems as well as in many others. Water is vary challenging for simulations since in practise most of the simulation times goes in simulation water as it is the most abundant component in any given system. This is quite easy to understand: In addition to the molecules of interest, say, proteins or lipids for example, the simulation box needs to be filled with water at the correct density and to reach proper solvation, enough water is needed. It is not uncommon that over 90% of the simulation time goes to simulation water.</p>
<p>While keeping water in is naturally the most correct choice, methods have bee developed to include water only implicitly - such models are called implicit solvent models. There are several strategies for doing but the <em>Generalized Born model</em> is probably the most commonly used one.</p>

<p>Coarse-graining is a process in which one tries to reduce the number of <em>degrees of freedom</em> in order to be able to simulate larger systems for longer times. There many approaches to coarse-grain but as a general idea, one can consider a molecule such as a lipid in the Figure and somehow determine new larger <em>superatoms</em>. It may sound like magic, but there is a solid theoretical procedure do that (Henderson’s theorem) but - like with everything - there are limitations and complexities.</p>
<p>Here is a brief list of some coarse-grained  MD methods:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Direct coarse graining using the Henderson theorem.</p></li>
<li><p>Adaptive Resolution Simulations (AdResS).</p></li>
<li><p>The MARTINI model. This is the most popular approach. The name MARTINI does not refer to the drink, but the Gothic style church steeple in the city of Groningen, the Netherlands. The tower was completed in 1482 and it is the most famous landmark in the city. The developers of the model, Marrink and co-workers are based at the University of Groningen. As an unrelated note (but Canadian connection), the city of Groningen was librated by Canadian troops in World War II.</p></li>
<li><p>Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). The DPD method is an other popular coarse-grained method. It was originally developed as a fluid flow solver at Shell laboratories by Hoogerbrugge and Koelman in 1991. The original method had, however, an error: It could not produce the correct equilibrium state with Boltzmann distribution; this is a strict requirement that arises from statistical mechanics (and it will discussed in detail later). This problem was fixed through the theoretical work of Espanol and Warren in 1995, and their formulation is the one that is universally used.</p></li>
<li><p>PLUM model. The PLUM model resembles MARTINI in the sense that the level of coarse-graining is the same. The philosophies of the two models are, however, different. PLUM was developed by Bereau and Deserno.</p></li>
<li><p>ELBA model. The ELBA model was developed by Orsi and Essex in 1991 primarly for lipid simulations. Whereas many other CG models igonre electrostatic interactions (or most of them), ELBA is unique in including them. The name ELBA comes from ‘electrostatics-based’.</p></li>
<li><p>SIRAH model. The name comes from ‘Southamerican Initiative for a Rapid and Accurate Hamiltonian’ and it has its origin in the Institute Pasteour de Montevideo in Urugay. SIRAH is based on a top down approach.</p></li>

<p>As the number of different models and the existence of various hybrid models suggests, there are different approached to coarse-graining. These will not be discussed in detail, but it is good to understand the there are two philosophies: <em>sequential</em> and <em>concurrent</em>. Sequential means that data is first extracted from a higher accuracy model. That data is then used construct a coasre-grained model. In <em>concurrent</em> coarse-graining, CG is done on-the-fly.</p>

<h3>Beyond particles: Different representations and methods<a class="headerlink" href="#beyond-particles-different-representations-and-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Not all coarse-grained simulation methods use particles. The most common ones are the finite element method (FEM), phase field models and the lattice-Boltzmann method. In all of these cases the space is meshed, that is, the space is discretized. This discretization is typically regular such as based on squares, cubes, triangle or something else, but it can also be random or adaptive.</p>
<p><strong>Monte Carlo:</strong> Purely stochastic, total momentum is not conserved. This is a general methodology and does not imply the anything about the application. Monte Carlo can be used for problems as different as optimizing railway network traffic and to study quantum phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>FEM:</strong> The finite element method is essentially a method for solving partial differential equations (PDE). The idea is simple: discretize the space <em>elements</em>. It then uses methods based on calculus of variations to solve the problem at hand. As the above implies, it is a very general method and not limited to any particular field. Typical application fields include structural analysis and heat flow. The idea of elements in obvious if one considers a bridge: To model various designs, one can consider the trusses to be the finite elements that have, for example, elastic properties. The elements are meshed and the PDEs (what exactly they are depends on the problem at hand) are then solved numerically.</p>
<p><strong>Phase field:</strong> In the case of phase field models, the space is typically discretized using a regular grid and the relevant PDEs are solved using <em>finite differebce methods</em> on a grid. The PDEs arise from the physical proprties of the system: The system is described by an <em>order parameter</em>. The order parameter is a central concept in fields such as <em>physical chemistry</em> and <em>condensed matter physics</em> and it describes the emergence of order in a system. In the disorder state (high temperature), the order paramater is zero. When the system undergoes a phase transition (temperature is lowered), the order parameter becomes small and finite, and it is bounded from above to the value of one. Thus, order parameter of one describes full order. The difficulty is that there is no unique way of determining the order parameter but its choice depends on the system. One thus needs deep knowledge of ths system and its behavior. Examples of order parameter are the density in the case of a liquid-gas transition and the wavefunction in the case of superconductivity.</p>
<p><strong>Lattice-Boltzmann:</strong> In this case the space is again meshed using a regular mesh. Then a fluid is described a density at each of the nodes. The idea is to then solve for the density and flow by approximating the Boltzmann transport equation. The simplest single-relaxation time approx to Bolzmann transport equation is the so-called Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation and it is commonly used in LB.  This method can be hybridized with particle models.</p>

In lattice-Boltzmann simulations, computation is done on a grid and atoms can be included as coarse-grained composite entities. In phase field models, there are no individual atoms.

<h2>Why do we need so many methods?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-we-need-so-many-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Why do we need some many methods? There are various reasons, so let’s take a look at some. First, let’s look at the number of atoms/components.</p>
<p>A typical classical MD simulation has 10,000-100,000 atoms. The atoms are treated as entities interacting via pair potentials and electrons (or nuclei) are not taken into account separately. Without considering technical details, let’s naively assume that that there is some relatively straightforward way of treating electrons and nuclei. A system of 10,000 atoms would then contain many more entities. If the system has only hydrogens, then the total number of particles would be 20,000. Let’s consider carbon-12. It has 6 protons, 6 neutrons and 6 electrons: Each atom has 18 smaller entities. This would make the 10,000 atom system to a 180,000 atom system. How about gold? It has 79 protons, 118 neutrons and 79 electrons. This means that each Au atom has 276 smaller entities and a system of 10,000 atoms would then consist of 2,760,000 particles. Here are some issues that one needs to consider.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Classical treatment: Newton’s equation of motion, positions and velocities</p></li>
<li><p>Quantum mechanics: Schrödinger equation, wavefunction</p></li>
<li><p>Discrepancy in velocities: The fastest motion determines time step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider this: In hydrogen, electrons (1s) move at about 0.7% speed of light!</p></li>
<li><p>In classical MD, the time step is typically 1-2 fs (or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1-2 \times 10^{-15}\)</span> s)</p></li>
<li><p>In coarse-grained MD, the time step depends on the level of description: In the popular MARTINI model the time step is usually 10-40 fs, in dissipative particle dynamics about 10 ps.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="programming-languages">
<h2>Programming languages<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-languages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One typical question is: Does one need to be able to program? The simple answer is yes. One needs to know some programming independent of if one does computation, theory or experiments. Below is a brief discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Which programming language should I use/learn?</strong> Depends on the needs, the level desired knowledge and application(s). For example, Python is a general purpose language that can be used for many purposes and it is particularly useful for analyzing and visualzing data indpendent if the data is from simulations, experiments or some database. Python is very quick to learn and it has amazing amount of libraries and routines for almost any imaginable task, and the community is large and very supportive. Python is an interpreted language. Python is a langauge that has become a must learn independent of field and application, and it is particularly important in machine learning. We will also use Python.</p>
<p>C/C++ have a different nature than Python. They have to be compiled and they have much more rigidily defined structure. C/C++ codes are great for writing high-performance simulation codes and, for example in the field of molecular simulations, Gromacs, LAMMPS and NAMD are written in C/C++. Earlier versions of LAMMPS were written in Fortran, but there was a transition to C++. Learning C/C++ is more useful for writing general purpose codes than Fortran. As for syntax, C/C++ and Python have lots of similarities.</p>
<p>Fortran is an older programming language and it was originally designed to be very efficient for numerical calculations. The name Fortran comes from <em>For</em>mula <em>Tran</em>slation. Although there has been a shift to C/C++, many HPC codes such as CP2K, Orca and Gaussian are written in Fortran.</p>
<p>Graphics processing units (GPU) are used increasingly in high performance computing. They use languages such as CUDE for NVIDIA GPUs, HIP for AMD GPUs and OpenCL that is GPU agnostic. In high performance computing CUDA is the dominant one while HIP is starting to gain ground. Syntactically, they have a very high resemblance to C/C++.</p>
<p>As for computers - and as will be discussed shortly - the Linux operating system is the dominant in the world of higher performance computing. Linux will also be used here. As for programming per se, it can be done in any of the common environments, that is, Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.</p>
