    "We start by discussing some basic aspects of computers and computing. This includes High Performance Computing (HPC), the basic idea of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and requirements. The aim is not to have an in-depth discussion but to introduce some of the common terms which we will need later on and which are important for anyone planning to use any type of computing facilities. Basic knowledge about hardware and its relation to software especially when one runs parallel simulations is crucial in order to use the computing facilities efficiently. Is is very easy to have a drastic drop in performance by choosing wrong number of processing cores, GPUs or/and nodes - more or cores and nodes may very easily lead to significant loss in performance. We address some of those issues here and also discuss them later when we set up simulations, but get an idea why that is one needs to keep in mind that in order for processors to operate in parallel thay must share information. If the proportion of information that needs to be shared is large compared to the information each processor can process *independent of the other processors* then communication regarding the information that must be shared can become an obstacle. Another scenario is when the processor execute tasks that end at different times. In that case, the processors that finish faster must wait for the slowest processes to complete. Thus, one must balance the workload appropriately.\n",

It is highly likely that your own personal laptop or desktop is capable for some quite advanced tasks espcially if equipped with a discrete GPU; although the name GPU refers to graphics, GPUs are not limited to graphics and one can program more or less any algorithm and use GPUs. GPUs were designed for *floating point arthimetics* - this is exactly what is needed in most simulations of physical systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most HPC is done using computer clusters (such as [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/)). A cluster is - as the name suggests - a cluster of individual computers that are connected to each other. These individual computers are called nodes. Inter-node networking is one of the most critical parts of any cluster since it largelry determines latency - the nodes need to share information between each other and that can easily be the rate-limiting step for a given computing task. This is the reason why there are many different networking solutions such as Infiniband (>200Gb/s). The properties of each node are determined by the individual computer that makes up the node. If all computers, that is nodes,  in a cluster are identical, then the cluster is called homogeneous (in contrast to heretogeneous). An individual user doesn't access the nodes directly but through a *login node*, also called *head node*. That is the user's gateway to the cluster's resources and the *head node* can sometimes be used for quick tests or using GUI-based software over VNC, but the system policies should always be checked beforehand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure shows a typical computing cluster with 16 individual nodes. There is also another computing paradigm called SMP - Symmetric Multi-Processing. In this case there are multiple CPUs but they all share the same memory (in a cluster all the nodes have individual independent memory). SMP clusters are typically used for special-purpose simulationsand require very large amount memory.\n",

    "<div class=\"int\">\n",

    "\n",
    "</div>    \n",
    "    \n",
    "When starting computing jobs, an individual user cannot simply fire them away and sit back. Rather, all the computing jobs are sent to the cluster using a *scheduler.* There are several types of schedulers but nowadays the [SLURM scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager) is the most common one, this is also what Compute Canada uses.

They represent numbers in binary form, that is, zeros and ones. Physically, CPUs are on an integrated circuit (IC), or what is often called the chip (metal oxide semiconductor). The chip is *not* synonymous to CPU since it typically has also other components on it, in particular [cache memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache). Some computers employ a multi-core processor, which is a single chip or \"socket\" containing two or more CPUs called \"cores\".\" We will use this concept directly when compiling and running simulations. \n",

It is a more general term than CPU and it is also used in the case [digital signal processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor) (DSP) and others. In the case of a single core processor, the commands, or instructions to be more precise, are executed sequentially one after another. A new task cannot start before the previous one has finished. In the case of a *multi-core* processor, a single integrated circuit (or chip) contains several physical CPUs (cores) that can execute several processes simultaneously in parallel. This sometimes called the [MIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMD), or *Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data* paradigm. Note: The term multi-CPU is *not* the same as multi-core. In the case of a multi-CPU, the processing units are not on the same integrated circuit as in the case of multicore. More or less all current processors are multicore - if you don't know how many cores you have, we will check that shortly and make use of the cores to speed up simulations.\n",

For this reason, GPUs have been optimized for parallel processing as compared to CPUs that have their origin in serial processng. In addition, they were designed to handled floating point numbers very efficiently. Programming-vice, there are significant differences between programs that are designed for GPUs vs CPUs since the parallelism is the paradigm of GPU computing; *[vectorisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming)* and multi-threading are the two main differences. GPUs are now part of any typical HPC cluster and they for tasks such as molecular simulations and machine learning GPUs are programmed with C++-like languages, the general purpose [OpenCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) and NVIDIA specific [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA).

GPUs also operate similarly to vector computers. So the question is: What is a vector computer? Let's start from serial computers, that's essentially what our PCs are. Without going into the details of computer architecture, serial means that one instruction is performed at a time; data is retrieved and then an operation is performed on it. In vector processing the processor uses one instruction to operate on a whole vector at the same time (=parallel operation; [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD), Single Instruction Multiple Data). Processors that are designed to operate in parallel on multiple data are called vector processors in contrast to scalar processors that use a single data element at a time (a pure serial processing is [SISD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SISD), Single Instruction Single Data). We will not discuss these matters in detail in this course, but it is good to have an idea of the concept. \n",
