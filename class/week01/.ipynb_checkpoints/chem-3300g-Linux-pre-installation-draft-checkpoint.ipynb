    "  1. <em style=\"color:navy;\">You can install dual boot</em>. In that case you will have both Linux and Windows installed and you select at boot time which one you want to use.

    "There are a lot of great Linux distributions to choose from. Here, instructions are given for Ubuntu-based systems. It is by no means the only choice. \n",

If you have not used Linux before, then the easiest way is use one of the Ubuntu based ones. There are many other excellent distributions and you can typically try them without installinf by simply making a Live USB (see below).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation regarding Ubuntu version:** It is strongly recommended to install an LTS (Long Term Support) version. At this time (fall 2020), the latest LTS version is 20.04 LTS. The instructions below have been tested with this particular version (as well as to some degree using 18.04 LTS). Why LTS and not the absolute latest? Ubuntu releases come in 6 month cycles (April and October), but the LTS versions are released every two years. Importantly, the LTS versions are supported and maintaned for *five* years. In other words it is a stable solution without the need to upgrade. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Which distribution/version/flavor you use?** Right now, our student office computers run the default Ubuntu, my 2007 iMac runs Ubuntu Budgie and my laptop runs KDE Neon. All of the computers run LTS versions of Ubuntu (mostly 18.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS). I have used Linux since 1993 and tried many distributions including Slackware, Redhat/Fedore, SuSe, Gentoo, Arc, Elementary OS and so on.\n",

    "**Try it first using Live USB *without* installing.** This allows you try it out without installing. This is important since this weay you can see that Wifi and other devices work properly and also check that you like the interface. Here are the basic steps (the suggestions below are Ubuntu or Ubuntu-based for ease):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To make a Live USB you need a USB pen, larger than 4GB is recommended (and often needed). If you want  to try several distributions/flavors at the same time, just have 2 or more pens ready. Note that the USB pen needs to be erased (and formatted) in the process so make sure that if it isn't empty, you copy all the important files to another USB/SD/HD/SSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take a look and browse at the web pages of the different flavors/distributions and see what pleases you visually. Functionally, they all contain the same features. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Suggestions:\n",
    " - [Ubuntu Desktop default](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)\n",
    "     * Note: Pick Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (20.04.01 LTS at the time of writing this), NOT any of the newer ones.\n",
    " - [The official Ubuntu flavours](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours).\n",
    "     *  For those coming from Windows or Mac, Ubuntu Budgie may be the most familiar looking. Simply take a look at their respective pages and see what pleases you visually. \n",
    " - [Elementary OS 5.1 Hera](https://elementary.io/)\n",
    "     * Uses Ubuntu/Debian package management.\n",
    "     * Beautiful Mac-like user interface design\n",
    " - [Linux Mint 20 Ulyana:](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)\n",
    "     * Uses Ubuntu/Debian package management.\n",
    "     * Beautiful Windows-like design\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you have made your choice, download the one(s) you want. The files that you download are so-called [ISO images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image). It is a standard archive format that we use to create a bootable USB. Note that the ISO images can be large, anything between 1 and 4 GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a bootable USB. The links below contain step-by-step instructions and work for all of the above Linux flavours/versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - [Ubuntu tutorials: Create a bootable USB stick on Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows)\n",
    "  - [Ubuntu tutorials: Create a bootable USB stick on macOS](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now you can try it out. Simply insert the USB and reboot your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Potential problems:\n",
    "  - The computer boots back to Windows (or Mac). This means that USB is not recognized as a boot device. This is easy to change:\n",
    "      - Reboot the computer and enter bios. How this is done depends on bit on your computer. When you reboot, many computers usually show (for a few seconds) what are the keys to press to enter bios. This depends on your computer, but here are a few examples:\n",
    "         * The two most common keys to hold down while booting are F10 and F12. \n",
    "         * Dell XPS 13:\n",
    "         * Lenovo: \n",
    "         * Not here? Then you have to search the web. It is good to know this since if there evere is a serious problem with your Windows, you may need this to be able to recover your computer and OS. \n",
    "     - Once in bios, go into the boot menu and change the order of bootable devices such that USB comes first. Save and reboot. Now (provided the USB is inserted), the computer should boot to Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now you should be running Linux from the USB. Try it out, connect the Wifi, open software from the menus and see that everything works as expected. If everything is fine and you like the visual features, then all is good. Let's not install yet before discussing a few issues. So select reboot from the menu, and remove the USB when requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If you want to try another distribution/flavour, just repeat the steps.    \n",

    "Now that you have tested at least one Linux distribution from a USB, it is time to install. There are four possible choices depending what you want. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "<div class=\"info\">\n",
    "1. <b>Pure Linux</b>, that is, the other exisiting operating system(s) will be completely deleted and after the installation Linux will be the only OS.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Requirements:\n",
    "    - Linux is not very resource hungry. This means that if there is an older unused computer hanging around, it will probably run Linux just fine. Practical examples: I have installed Linux (Ubuntu Budgie 20.04 LTS) on an 2007 iMac with 8Gb memory and it runs fine. There are also special lightweight Linux versions that run perfectly well even on older netbooks (I have tried some versions on an old Toshiba netwook with 2 Gb of memory).\n",
    " - Advantages: Clean installation.\n",
    " - Disadvantages: If you need software that runs only on Mac or Windows. \n",
    " - [Instructions: New computer came with windows pre-installed but you want Linux only](https://github.com/mejk/computer-stuff/blob/master/ubuntu/new-computer-linux-only-win-preinstalled.md)\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "2. <b>Dual boot.</b> Allows you to select at boot time which OS you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Requirements: \n",
    "      - You need to have enough strorage space depending on your needs. Examples: if one doesn't need to store large files, a 256Gb SSD works just fine. Linux is less resource-hungry than Windows or Mac, so if your computer runs one of them, there should be no issues.\n",
    "   - Advantages:\n",
    "      - Windows and Linux are clearly separated each of them being a full native installation.\n",
    "   - Disadvantages: \n",
    "     - You need to boot to switch from Linux to Windows or vice versa (but then again, that is quick).\n",
    "     - Some manufacturers ship Windows installed with [BitLocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLocker) turned on. If that is the case, things become more complex as the HD/SSD tends to be fragmented and it is not necessearily trivial to defragment it.\n",
    "   - Additional:\n",
    "     - The Linux side can access the files on the Windows side but not vice versa.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "3. <b>Install Linux in a virtual machine inside your current OS</b>.\n",
    " \n",
    "  - Requirements: Since memory is shared between the two oprating systems when the virtual machine is turned on, one needs enough RAM. Typically 16 Gb seems to work fine, 12 Gb is ok and 8 Gb not quite enough.\n",
    "  - Advantages: \n",
    "     - Allows you to install full Linux (or other operating systems, including different versions) in a contained environment without need to repartition the hard drive/SSD. \n",
    "  - Disadvantages:\n",
    "     - As discussed above, memory shared between the two OSs when virtual machine is turned on. The practical lower limit for RAM is 12 Gb.\n",
    "     - Virtual machine doesn't allow access for GPUs (if you don't have discrete GPU, then this is not an issue)\n",
    " \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. <b>If running Windows 10, install Linux using WSL/WSL2</b> ([WSL=Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)). This is different from the three options below in that you don't automatically get the GUI Linux tools, but just the command line terminal. It is possible to use GUI-based application as well, but for that one has to install an emulator for the X-windows environment.\n",
