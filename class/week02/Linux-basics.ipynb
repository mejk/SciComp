    "n.* An OS that is awesome for geeky programmers. For everyone else, it is much too difficult to install and use.<p></p>\n",
    "Linux will always have a small installed base on desktop computers, because the only way it can become mainstream is if it loses the difficulty of installation and use. The only way to attain that is to completely change what linux is.</p></p>\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;- by truth teller December 29, 2003\n",
    "\n",
    "This expresses well the still remaining <b>most common misconception</b> that Linux is only for coders and geeks, and that is cumbersome to install and use. While in the early days of Linux, and to a degree even in the early 2000's, that was true, at this time that is not at all the case. Modern Linux distributions are very easy and quick to install, easy to maintain and extremely stable. For normal users, there is no need to use the feared command line or terminal. Anecdotally I can say that having installed Windows, OSX and Linux simultaneously side-by-side, the Linux system was up and running with full functionality hours before the other two. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The persistent myth** of Linux being difficult to install and almost impossible to use for anyone but *geeky programmers* is very unfortunate. It is, as a matter fact, much faster and easier to install than, say, Windows or OSX (anyone who claims otherwise has not installed those two from scratch; in addition, the Windows and OSX updates tend to be very large, the latest at the time of writing this: MacOS update from *Catalina* to the new *Big Sur* is of the meager size of 12.18 GB that needs to be downloaded over the net and even the latest *Catalina* security update is 2.84 GB. It took over 35 minutes to install on a relatively new iMac). The user experience is also very similar to the other two main operating systems, and, importantly for the everyday user: there is no need for the terminal or the command line. Everything can be run in a menu-driven manner as with Windows and OSX. In our case that is different since the terminal window is the power user's best friend. \n",
    "\n",
    "In brief: Any modern Linux distribution works at least as well as Windows or Mac as the daily driver. As a concrete low-brow example, let's use anecdotal evidence: I installed ([Budgie Linux](https://ubuntubudgie.org/), one of the Ubuntu flavours) for my 79 old dad and he prefers it over Windows and Mac. He has never used the command line.  \n",
    "  - Of course  the example above is a bit silly. In that case, all the software that was needed (Skype, Zoom, Firefox, word processor, Spotify and email) was readily available through the *Software center*. There is software that needs to be installed through the command line and some repositories (like [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/)) must be initiated through the command line. What the above says, however, is that the user experience is good and may even be preferable to other OSs, but that is, naturally, totally subjective. \n",
    "  - As described above, there are - of course - some problems. Whether or not they are significant for you regarding your daily use, is yours to determine. There are plenty of problems with Windows and Mac as well but they are not discussed here.\n"

There are also special lightweight Linux versions that run perfectly well even on older netbooks (I have tried some versions on an old Toshiba netbook with 2 GB of memory).

    " - Disadvantages: If you need software that runs only on Mac or Windows (in particular MS Office and Adobe). \n",
    "    - Options: If you have enough RAM, it is always possible to install Windows using virtual machine inside Linux (see the Figure).\n",

    "\n",
    "   - Requirements: \n",
    "      - You need to have enough storage space depending on your needs. Examples: if one doesn't need to store large files, a total of 256Gb SSD works just fine. Linux is less resource-hungry than Windows or Mac, so if your computer runs one of them, there should be no issues.\n",
    "   - Advantages:\n",
    "      - Windows and Linux are clearly separated each of them being a full native installation.\n",
    "   - Disadvantages: \n",
    "     - You need to boot to switch from Linux to Windows or vice versa (but then again, that is quick).\n",
    "     - Some manufacturers ship Windows installed with [BitLocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLocker) turned on. If that is the case, things become more complex as the HD/SSD tends to be fragmented and it is not necessarily trivial to defragment it.\n",
    "   - Additional:\n",
    "     - The Linux side can access the files on the Windows side but not vice versa.\n",
    "   - Notes: \n",
    "     - While it is possible to install Linux first and add Windows after, it is highly recommended to have Windows first and then add the Linux part. That is usually the more natural order since most computers ship with Windows pre-installed.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "3. <b>Install Linux in a virtual machine inside your current OS</b>.\n",
    " \n",
    "  - Requirements: Since memory is shared between the two operating systems when the virtual machine is turned on, one needs enough RAM. Typically 16 Gb seems to work fine, 12 Gb is ok and 8 Gb can get a bit sticky.\n",
    "  - Advantages: \n",
    "     - Allows you to install full Linux (or other operating systems, including different versions) in a contained environment without the need to repartition the hard drive/SSD. \n",
    "  - Disadvantages:\n",
    "     - As discussed above, memory shared between the two OSs when virtual machine is turned on. The practical lower limit for RAM is 12 Gb.\n",
    "     - Virtual machine doesn't allow access for GPUs (if you don't have discrete GPU, then this is not an issue).\n",
    " \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. <b>If running Windows 10, install Linux using WSL/WSL2</b> ([WSL=Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)). This is different from the three options above in that you don't automatically get the GUI Linux tools, but just the command line terminal. It is possible to use GUI-based application as well, but for that one has to install an emulator for the X-windows environment.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Important:** For WSL, you must have Windows 10 and for WSL2 the only the following Windows 10 versions are compatible: version 2004 (May 2020), version 1909 (Nov. 2019) and version 1903 (May 2019).\n",
    "   - Advantages: Installation of WSL is very straightforward and WSL is supported by Microsoft. Installation is also very quick. \n",
    "   - Notes:\n",
    "      - WSL gives a CLI but no GUI. In practise you will have Windows and Linux on your system at the same time. \n",
    "      - Linux does have access to your files on the Windows side *but* Windows has no access to the files on the Linux side. All Linux CLI tools work well.\n",
    "      - GPU computing: WSL has no access to the GPU(s). This is going to change sometime in the future and currently there is an early version of WSL2 available with GPU access (requires Windows Insider registration). \n",

If we have a user <code class=\"wlblue\">sam</code>, then her home directory would be located in <code class=\"wlblue\">/home/sam</code>, that is, it is at the second level below the root directory.\n",

    "\n",
    ">“There are only two industries that refer to their customers as ‘users’.”<br> Edward Tufte, Professor of Political Science, Computer Science and Statistics, Yale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normal user:** Normal users don't have privileges to change systems setting or install software at the system level, just in their own private directories. This also means that they cannot accidentally or otherwise delete or modify anything in the system and wreck it. Even if one has superuser privileges ones should always operate as a normal user and use the superuser rights only when absolutely necessary. By default, that is, when you login, you are a normal users. This applies to both Windows and Linux. Superuser rights must be called explicitly in both systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Superuser:** For comparison: On Windows, the Linux/Unix *superuser*, also called *root*,  account corresponds to the *Administrator* account. The *Administrator* in Windows and the *superuser* have the privileges to modify the system files, add and delete users, and install software to the system (normal users can typically install some software in their private directories). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: What not to do.** Although this may sound trivial, it is impossible to overemphasize that you should never use the superuser privileges when they are not needed for system maintenance. Performing normal operations as the *superuser* has several risks, the most obvious one is that as a superuser you can delete and modify system files that may wreck your system and make it hard or impossible to recover without full re-installation. Normal users cannot do such damage. The worst damage a normal users can do is to destroy their own files and directories but that does not wreck the system. The situation is the same in all operating systems. Just to give an example: A superuser or a malicious intruder who has somehow acquired the superuser password can wipe out the full system with one single command. This brings in the next important issue.\n",
