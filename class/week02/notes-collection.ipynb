Thus, the difference between $m_e$ and $m_p$ is about four orders of magnitude. This very large difference in masses means that electrons move much faster than the nuclei and if the nuclei moved / are displaced, the electrons respond my adjusting almost instantaneously. For the same reason, the opposite is not true: the nuclei are not influenced by the motion of the electrons and they can be seen as remaining fixed from the electrons' perspective. This allows the separation of motions to electronic and nuclear, that is, they are treated as independent of each other. This is called the *Born-Oppenheimer approximation*. It was originally proposed by [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born) and [J. Robert Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer) in their article titled *Zur Quantentheorie der Molekeln* in 1927.\n",
