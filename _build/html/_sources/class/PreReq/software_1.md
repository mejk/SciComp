# Module: Installation of necessary software

<!--
```{include} test.md
```
-->

In this module, we will install most of the necessary software and familiarize ourselves with some basic concepts and background. In addition, getting used to the command line terminal is essential as it will be needed in almost everything.

```{important}
1. You must be able to install software on your computer. 
1. You are responsible for running virus checks.
1. Always take a backup before any major installations.
1. Don't block the ventilation openings of you computer.
```

## Software installations include                               :

**First one of the following is needed:**
  - For Mac users, Xcode is required. In addition, a package manager such as Homebrew or MacPorts is needed. 
  Most of the examples are with Homebrew.
  - For windows users: Windows subsystem for Linux WSL/ WSL2, virtual machine for Linux or dual 
  boot Windows-Linux. We will discuss these options.
  - Linux users: Nothing to do at this step, just check that the system is up-to-date and read the instructions/material

**For everyone to install:**

  - Python either using `pip` or Anaconda. The latter is recommended and easier to use, but the former is also ok.
    * Installing virtual environment is also highly recommended.
  - Jupyter Notebook / Lab.
  - C/C++ compilers and some other necessary software.
  - Plain text (ASCII) editor. Foe example, `vi`, emacs or such. Instructions for`vi` are provided in this module.

## When will we install software?

The above installations will be done mostly during the first lab on Monday of Week 2 (=there is no lab on the first Monday).
