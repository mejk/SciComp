    "Python is modern a interpreted language, as opposed to compiled programming languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Pascal, and so on. Being an interpreted language means that a Python interpreter reads the code line-by-line as it is executed. In contrast, a compiled language has to be run through a compiler to produce an executable program. The compiled executable works only on the platform where it was compiled, but a code that is interpreted is more portable between different platforms. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's get into Python. As mentioned above, it is very easy to start using it. We have to, however, understand a few basic things. The aim here is not programming in a broad sense but rather to use python for various simple tasks. Topic such as [*object oriented programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) will not be covered, the emphasis is put on simple data analysis an providing code snippets that can be re-used, for example, in analyses of experimental and computational data, in producing high quality plots for manuscripts, theses, talks and posters, and in using modules and packages for tasks such as [Markov analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). This part gives a very brief introduction and jump start to python. That is done in practise in mind: This section shows some plotting techniques for data generated inside python as well as for data that is read from a file/files. A few of the most important modules are briefly introduced: [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for plotting, [numpy](https://numpy.org/) for handling array data and [pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model) for statistical analyses. More will introduced as we progress. One important point is that python is a very versatile language and the number built-in and contributed modules is enormous. It is impossible to know all, or even a reasonable fraction, of them. Instead, it is very important to know how to search for information *and* how to use it. It is also very important to keep the following advice in mind:\n",

    "It may sound strange at first sight, but the statement is very important. One cannot start from writing a code but instead, there must be an idea as what is being analyzed or simulated. There is also the question if the code will be used only for a few times on a particular task or if it will be something that will be used frequently and by several users. It is also *absolutely vital* to verify even the simplest codes against known results/data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are common throughout the fields. For example, the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) is used to optimize public transportation schedules, design of integrated circuits, used in modeling quantum phenomena, to mention a few applications. Similarly, machine learning is used in everything from image processing to analyzing protein conformations and optimization methods are used in virtually all fields. \n",

In such a case, interrupting and re-running the kernel should clarify the situation.\n",

Note:  a good way to name your variables is to use *descriptive variable names*. There are some restrictions on variable naming and those restrictions will be discussed below.\n",

In *statically typed* languages such as C/C++ and Fortran, the types variables must be known and fixed and cannot be changed. In *dynamically typed* languages such as Python and [javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) that is not the case. This means that in addition to the value, the type of a variable may be changed. The second notable difference to languages such as C/C++ is that in Python one not have does declare variables. The type and value of a variable are assigned when the variable used the first time. This is best illustrated by an example (the variable names are arbitrary, the part that indicates the variable type is used for clarity):"

    "[Tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) are sometimes confusing, probably because they seem similar to lists. The term has its origin in mathematics (set theory) and  it can be defined as an *ordered set of elements*. N-tuple is an ordered list of *N* elements. If you are a database person, 'record' is roughly the same.  Tuples in python are *immutable*, their elements cannot be changed once they have been created unlike was the case with lists. This is a useful feature in certain situations.  Here are some practical points concerning tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indexing starts from zero (the same as with lists)\n",
    "- It is not possible to add (append/extend) or remove (remove/pop)  elements from a tuple. \n",
    "- Tuples are a safe way to store data (when appropriate). This is where immutability is the key.\n",
    "- Slicing works the same as with lists\n",
    "- When assigning a tuple, one uses the regular parenthesis\n",
    "- Since they are immutable, it is faster to retrieve information from a tuple than a list\n",
    "- There is a conversion routine between tuples and lists\n",
    "- Elements in a tuple can be mixed: You can have floats, integers, strings, lists, etc."

Seaborn is based on matplotlib and it allows changing styles, color palettes and other decorations very easily. In the next cell, we import Seaborn and define background, grid, fonts and line widths.

    "The cell below plots the data using `matplotlib` with the  `seaborn` settings to make the above plot pretty with nice and consistent fonts, control of tick marks, legends and so on. The line widths were determined in the previous cell so that if the plot is included in an article or thesis, everything should look good. At the end, there is an option to save as `png` and `svg`. While `png` is good for importing plots into Word, LaTeX or LibreOffice, `svg` (=[Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)) is scale free. That is, it can be used in posters without loss of resolution and it can be edited (without the need to replot), say, if one wants to change the line type or color. `svg` files can be edited using the excellent `inkscape` program (free and available for Windows, Mac and Linux) and then saved to `png` or any other format if necessary. Note also that `svg` can be directly imported in LibreOffice files and also in Jupyter Labs/Notebook and on web sites. It's usually a good idea so save in both formats but if one needs to pick one, `svg` is a much more flexible choice.\n"
