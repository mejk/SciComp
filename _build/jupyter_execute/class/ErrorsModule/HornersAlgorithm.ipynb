    "To illustrate the affect of accumulation of roundoff errors let's imagine a decimal computer that does floating point arithemetic using a 3-digit chop.  Let's use this to compute the value of a polynomial written in the standard monomial basis:\n",

    "Let $\\mathcal{fl}(.)$ denote the 3 digit chop operation and note that this imaginary computer must do this recursively (i.e. after every arithemtic operation) so an expression like  $\\mathcal{fl}(6 x^2)$ is evaluated as $\\mathcal{fl}(6 \\mathcal{fl}(x^2))$.  In particular, $ \\mathcal{fl}(4.71^2)=\\mathcal{fl}(22.1841)=22.1$ and $\\mathcal{fl}(6 \\mathcal{fl}(4.71^2))=\\mathcal{fl}(6\\times 22.1)=\\mathcal{fl}(132.6)=132$.  Doing this for every arithmetic operation leads to  \n",

    "Clearly we have lost a full digit of accuracy here (so only have 2 significant digits).  In this case, the result is not significantly improved using a rounding operation instead of a chop.  The question is:  Can we do any better or is this something we have to accept as part of not doing exact arithemtic?  The answer is that we can do better by rewriting the polynomial into a different, but mathematically equivalent form.  In this case, a nested multiplication:  \n",

    "much closer to the exact result (and still retaining 3 significant digits).  Why?  It turns out that $\\bar{p}(x)$ requires fewer arithmetic operations to compute than $p(x)$ and this results in a smaller accumulation of roundoff errors.    \n",
