## DMPC bilayer

DMPC bilayer with 128 lipids

- From [200 ns simulation of a DMPC bilayer](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2605546)

```{figure} ./dmpc128-ver1.png
:width: 600px
:name: dmpc1
:align: left

*DMPC bilayer with 128 lipids. Tails, headgroup P and N, and oxygens are shown with different colors and representations. Water molecules closer than 0.5 nm from the P atom are shown.*

```
