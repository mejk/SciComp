    "Almost all kinds of simulations in physics, chemistry, engineering, economics and social science use random numbers somewhere during the process. Random numbers are also needed in practical applications such as modelling he behavior of stock markets, machine learning and deep learning. Pehaps the most critical one is cryptography: Every time you use a computer or a mobile phone, you are using random numbers. The security of your on-line banking, purchases and messaging all depend on the random numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A precise mathematical definition of random numbers is difficult to give but let us start with an informal one, which contains the most important properties we demand from random numbers. First, we demand that the random numbers are evenly distributed in interval (0,1); as the preceding indicates, random numbers are assumed to be real. This is also how your computer's intrinsic RNG produces random numbers. The random numbers should be random. How can we define random? Intuitively, an arbitrarily long sequence of numbers should \"look\" random. That means that no sub-interval within (0,1) should be preferred, and there should be no recurring patterns or sequences of numbers. To be more precise, there should be no correlations between successive random numbers or sequences of of random numbers. We will return to this topic later and define some statistical and physical measures as how to study randomness. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask if it really matters or if it is really so hard to define what is random. As for the first question, it is easy to convince yourself if you think of, for example, a very practical and important problem of data encryption. If your random numbers have predictable correlations or repeating patterns, it may become very easy to break the encryption, which, in practice, could lead, for example, to unsafe transmission of you credit card information with on-line purchases. As for the second question, try to come up with a definition of randomness! Is the sequence {1,1,1,1} more random than {2190,9,1,14,276}? If you picked one over the other, what is your criterion and can be it applied generally? \n",

To overcome that difficulty, several algorithms have been developed  to produce sequences of pseudo-random numbers which mimic the true random numbers as well as possible. The goodness, i.e., quality, of these pseudo-random numbers can be tested in various ways as will be discussed below. When we discuss random numbers, we actually mean pseudo-random numbers unless otherwise mentioned. \n",

Such applications include calculation of critical exponents in continuous phase transitions and cryptography. \n",
