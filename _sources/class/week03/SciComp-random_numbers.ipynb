    "# Generating random numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "\"The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance.\"\n",
    "<br>- Robert R. Coveyou, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "Almost all kinds of simulations in physics, chemistry, engineering, economics and social science use random numbers somewhere during the process. The use of random numbers is extremely common in practical applications and modelling of physical phenomena ranging from radioactive decay to the behavior of stock markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "A precise mathematical definition of random numbers is difficult to give but let us start with an informal one, which contains the most important properties we demand from random numbers. First, we demand that the random numbers are evenly distributed in interval (0,1); as the preceding indicates, random numbers are assumed to be real. This is also how your computer's intrinsic RNG produces random numbers. The random numbers should be random. How can we define random? Intuitively, an arbitrarily long sequence of numbers should \"look\" random. That means that no sub-interval within (0,1) should be preferred, and there should be no recurring patterns or sequences of numbers. To be more precise, there should be no correlations between successive random numbers or sequences of of random numbers. We will return to this topic later and define some statistical and physical measures as how to study randomness. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask if it really matters or if it is really so hard to define what is random. As for the first question, it is easy to convince yourself if you think of, for example, a very practical and important problem of data encryption. If your random numbers have predictable correlations or repeating patterns, it may become very easy to break the encryption, which, in practice, could lead, for example, to unsafe transmission of you credit card information with on-line purchases. As for the second question, try to come up with a definition of randomness! Is the sequence {1,1,1,1} more random than {2190,9,1,14,276}? If you picked one over the other, what is your criterion and can be it applied generally? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical tidbits\n",
    "\n",
    "As John von Neumann joked, \"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "## Random numbers vs Pseudo-random numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "'Random' numbers chosen by humans:\n",
    " In a recent study it was shown that 17 is the most common 'random number' \n",
    "when people were asked to choose a random number between 1 and 20. \n",

    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "As indicated above, our aim is to generate random numbers using deterministic algorithms. That sounds almost like an oxymoron: how can we produce random numbers using a deterministic algorithm? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first classify random numbers in the following two categories \n",
    "1. True random numbers and \n",
    "2. Pseudo-random numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "True random numbers are produced by a physical process such as radioactive decay. These numbers are truly random in the sense that there are no correlations present and that the successive numbers are totally unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those numbers are tabularized and may then be used. The problem is, however, that that method is very impractical. To overcome that difficulty, several algorithms have been developed  to produce sequences of pseudo-random numbers which mimic the true random numbers as well as possible. The goodness, i.e., quality, of these pseudo-random numbers can be tested in various ways as will be discussed below. When we discuss random numbers, we actually mean pseudo-random numbers unless otherwise mentioned. \n",

    "## Requirements for a good Random Number Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomness \n",
    "2. Long period. \n",
    "3. RNG should be portable from one CPU architecture to another \n",
    "4. The algorithm should be fast and use little memory \n",
    "5. The algorithm should be parallelizable \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Uniform Random Numbers\n",
    "When talking about random numbers, we typically mean uniformly distributed random numbers. Typically we mean that random numbers are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. It is then possible to generate other distributions from thos uniform distribution, e.g., using the Box-Müller method. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Congruential Generator are the one of the oldest and most common types of pseudo-random number generator. They are very easy to implement, they are fast, and use minimal amount of memory. They are also very portable, but the downside is that they do not produce high-quality random numbers.  Thus, when randomness is critical, LCGs should not be used. Such applications include calculation of critical exponents in continuous phase transitions and cryptography. \n",

    "        \n",
    "The above is a recurrence relation and numbers $\\{x_i \\}$ form a set of pseudo-random numbers. Notice also the above equation is defines line with a modulo operation added. The modulo operation means that the result is wrapped if it exceeds the limit set by $m$ since the modulo operation returns the remainder of $(ax_i + c)/m$. LCG generator is said to be of full period if the period is exactly $m$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters are defined as follows \n",
    "- $a$: multiplier. $1<a<m$.  \n",
    "- $c$: increment. $0 \\le c < m$.  \n",
    "- $m$: period. The operation is even faster if $m$ is chosen to be a power of 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, one needs a seed ($x_0$) to start the random number generator. The seed has to be supplied when the RNG is called the first time. Using the above parameters, the following notation is typically used for LCGs: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathrm{LCG}(a,c,m)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been well established that LCGs are very sensitive to the choice of $a$, $c$, and $m$. Generators with $c=0$ are called multiplicative congruential generators (MCG). Sometimes generators with $c \\> 0$ are called mixed. For MCG's $0 < s < m$. It has been shown \\cite{xx} that MCGs  are never full period. For MCGs, typical notation is thus \n",

That is not enough, but $a$ and $c$ have to be chose carefully as well. That is somewhat of an art and there are tables listing 'safe' numbers $a$, $c$, and $m$. \n",

    "is influenced by random forces acting between ``$i$'' and other \n",
    "neighboring particles nearby. Since the number of neighboring \n",
    "particles $K$ is usually small and not conserved, the motion \n",
    "of the particle ``$i$'' is dictated by a short random \n",
    "number sequence $\\{ x_i \\} = x_1, \\ldots, x_K$, whose size \n",
    "$K$ fluctuates in time. Furthermore, the random number sequences \n",
