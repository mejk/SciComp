    "The composite trapezoidal rule is functional, but not all that accurate.  At this point, the only method we have to improve accuracy is to divide the interval into smaller segments.  We can, however, use results for different step sizes $h$ to improve both results by eliminating the lowest order error.  To illustrate, consider the trapezoidal rule for a step $h_1=(b-a)$ and then $h_2=(b-a)/2$,  \n",
