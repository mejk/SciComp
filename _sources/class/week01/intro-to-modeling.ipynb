    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Computational chemistry and physics are relatively young fields -->  \n",
    "Scientific computing and computational modeling are relatively young fields -\n",
    "this is easy to understand since the first digital (in contrast to mechanical) computers were developed in the late 1930's. The first programmable computer, the [Z1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z1_(computer)), was developed by [Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse) in Germany in the late 1930's. The early developments in programmable digital computers were largely driven by military applications in 1940's and 1950's. \n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest computers were not reliable or stable, or were built more as calculators for a single purpose. ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) that was built in 1946 is often said to be the first real computer. Transistors did not exist at that time and [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC) (in Philadelphia) had 17,480 vacuum tubes. Its original purpose was to determine trajectories for ballistic missiles, but due to the war ending it was used to study nuclear reactions. Nuclear warhead and storage related simulations are still one of the main uses of the largest supercomputers. One additional notable aspect of ENIAC is that, unlike modern computers, it was not able to store programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "ENIAC was followed by [MANIAC I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANIAC_I) (Mathematical Analyzer Numerical Integrator And Computer Model I at Los Alamos) and it was used in the landmark paper *\"Equations of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines\"*{cite}`Metropolis1953` by Metropolis et al. that introuced the Metropolis Monte Carlo method, one of the most used and important algorithms even today. MANIAC was also used in the development of the hydrogen bomb. Generalization of the Metropolis Monte Carlo method is known as the [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) and it is important in fields such as optimization and machine learning. On pure chemistry side, the earliest computational papers appeared in the 1960's and the term computational chemistry was (probably; hard to trace) first used in 1970's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, scientific computing and computational modeling have their roots in physics and chemistry, but independent if one talks about physics, chemistry or some other field, the development can be divided roughly in the theoretical developments in the field, developments of numerical methods and algorithms, and hardware. The development of numerical methods cannot be over-emphasized as it is critical to be able to model and simulate larger systems and for longer times. This will become clear as we discuss various methods and how they scale in terms of the number of degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, computational approaches such as hybrid methods that combine quantum mechanical and classical molecular dynamics and coarse-grained methods have gained a lot of popularity. Methods that combine different time and/or length scales can in general be called *[multiscale methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiscale_modeling)* and this will be discussed in more detail later. In addition, methods that go under the term *[machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)* are perhaps the most rapidly growing family of methods and they are applied in almost all imaginable fields from medicine to digital humanities and computational chemistry. Machine learning is not a simulation method as such, but rather a class of methods that allows classification (clustering), analyses and model building using large data sets. Machine learning methods rely heavily on statistics, linear algebra and stochastic methods such as [Markov processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). We will discuss such methods later.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is difficult to define what exactly computational chemistry is or is not. Wikipedia defines quite broadly (and one could say adeqately) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "\"Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of theoretical chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion (dihydrogen cation, see references therein for more details), the quantum many-body problem cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form. While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical experiments, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical phenomena. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials. \"    \n",
    "</blockquote>    \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the field of computational chemistry didn't exist in the 1830's, [Auguste Comte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Comte), the philosopher behind [positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism), stated that it is impossible and destructive to try to study chemistry using mathematics (and as an extrapolation by computers):\n",
    "\n",

    "questions must be considered profoundly irrational and contrary to the\n",

    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "It is also somewhat curious given that in Comte's own hierarchy of sciences, mathematics was the most fundamental meaning that all the other sciences use it.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than trying to provide a strict defintion or classification as what computational chemistry is, let's rather list methods and approaches use by computational chemists - after all computational chemistry includes various simulation techniques, structural analysis, using computers to design or predict new molecules or/and molecular binding, and data mining from experimental and/or computational results. It is also hard - and unnecessary - to draw strict defintion between computational chemistry, physics or, say, chemical engineering or pharmacy/drug design. Although these fields all have their own special characteristics, from the computational perspective they share the same methods and methodologies many of them, especially when it come to algorithms and computational techniques, come from applied mathematics and computer science. Right now, we restrict ourselves just to provide and a list and we will discuss some of them in detail later. For most part here, we focus on simulation and we will also discuss some analysis and machine learning techniques. What is also common to the computational disciplines is that one needs in-depth knowledge across traditional disciplines.    \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with experiments, there is no single correct choice for a computational method. Choosing the most appropriate method for the task at hand depends on various issues. First and foremost, what is the phenomenon/phenomena that is being studied. For example, if one is interested in the behavior of electrons, then quantum mechanical methods are the obvious candidates. This immediately brings in additional questions such as are we interested in band structure, chemical reactions, excited states or something else. Such questions are very important since they again narrow down the choice of methods. For example, if one is studied excited states, the usual methods from density functional theory are not enough. On the other hand, if one is interested in formation of micelles or diffusion of molecules, quantum mechanical methods are useless and the more reasonable choices would be classical MD or coarse-grained MD. Why? Collective phenomena such aggregate formation doesn't  depends directly on quantum mechanical properties (although some of them are implicitly integrated in the higher level models such as classical MD). One may also be interested in static or dynamic phenomena. In the former case, optimization methods may be method of choice whereas in the latter case one needs an equation of motion that is integrated in time. \n",

    "\n",
    "{numref}`scales1` lists some common models. It is important to notice that it is possible to combine, or hybridize them. The most common hybridization is perhaps the QM/MM methods, that is, combination of a quantum mechanical  method with a method from the classical MD level; the acronym MM stands for molecular mechanics and it is often used synonymously with classical MD although strictly speaking that is not the case. The principle is simple: In QM/MM, a small part of the system is treated using quantum mechanics and the rest with classical (Newtonian) mechanics. Although the idea is simple, there are many complications and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to QM/MM, it is possible combine classical MD and coarse-grained MD. Another fairly common combination is [lattice-Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods) (LB) and molecular dynamics. There, the difficulties are different since the lattice-Boltzmann method uses a grid to solve fluid motion using densities (=no explicit particles), but classical MD brings in particles. This means that the two must coupled in consistent way. Often that means using composite particles instead of 'normal' atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit vs explicit water\n",
    "\n",
    "When simulating biomolecular systems as well as many others, water is present. Water is very challenging for simulations since in practise most of the simulation times goes in simulation water as it is the most abundant component in any given system. This is quite easy to understand: In addition to the molecules of interest, say, proteins, lipids or polymers, for example, the simulation box needs to be filled with water at the *correct density* and to reach proper *solvation*, enough water is needed. It is not uncommon that over 90% of the simulation time goes to simulating water. \n",
    "\n",
    "While keeping water in is naturally the most correct choice, methods have been developed to include water only implicitly - such models are called implicit solvent models. There are several strategies for doing but the *Generalized Born model* is probably the most commonly used one.\n",

There many approaches to coarse-grain but as a general idea, one can consider a molecule such as a lipid in the Figure and somehow determine new larger *superatoms*. It may sound like magic, but there is a solid theoretical procedure do that (Henderson's theorem) but - like with everything - there are limitations and complexities. \n",

    "- Direct coarse graining using the Henderson theorem.\n",
    "- Adaptive Resolution Simulations (AdResS). \n",

The tower was completed in 1482 and it is the most famous landmark in the city. The developers of the model, Marrink and co-workers are based at the University of Groningen. As an unrelated note (but Canadian connection), the city of Groningen was librated by Canadian troops in World War II.\n",
    "- Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). The DPD method is an other popular coarse-grained method. It was originally developed as a fluid flow solver at Shell laboratories by Hoogerbrugge and Koelman in 1991. The original method had, however, an error: It could not produce the correct equilibrium state with Boltzmann distribution; this is a strict requirement that arises from statistical mechanics (and it will discussed in detail later). This problem was fixed through the theoretical work of Espanol and Warren in 1995, and their formulation is the one that is universally used. \n",
    "- PLUM model. The PLUM model resembles MARTINI in the sense that the level of coarse-graining is the same. The philosophies of the two models are, however, different. PLUM was developed by Bereau and Deserno. \n",
    "- ELBA model. The ELBA model was developed by Orsi and Essex in 1991 primarly for lipid simulations. Whereas many other CG models igonre electrostatic interactions (or most of them), ELBA is unique in including them. The name ELBA comes from 'electrostatics-based'.\n",
    "- SIRAH model. The name comes from 'Southamerican Initiative for a Rapid and Accurate Hamiltonian' and it has its origin in the Institute Pasteour de Montevideo in Urugay. SIRAH is based on a top down approach.\n",

    "### Concurrent vs sequential coarse-graining\n",

    "As the number of different models and the existence of various hybrid models suggests, there are different approached to coarse-graining. These will not be discussed in detail, but it is good to understand the there are two philosophies: *sequential* and *concurrent*. Sequential means that data is first extracted from a higher accuracy model. That data is then used construct a coasre-grained model. In *concurrent* coarse-graining, CG is done on-the-fly.\n",

    "### Beyond particles: Different representations and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all coarse-grained simulation methods use particles. The most common ones are the finite element method (FEM), phase field models and the lattice-Boltzmann method. In all of these cases the space is meshed, that is, the space is discretized. This discretization is typically regular such as based on squares, cubes, triangle or something else, but it can also be random or adaptive. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Monte Carlo:** Purely stochastic, total momentum is not conserved. This is a general methodology and does not imply the anything about the application. Monte Carlo can be used for problems as different as optimizing railway network traffic and to study quantum phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**FEM:** The finite element method is essentially a method for solving partial differential equations (PDE). The idea is simple: discretize the space *elements*. It then uses methods based on calculus of variations to solve the problem at hand. As the above implies, it is a very general method and not limited to any particular field. Typical application fields include structural analysis and heat flow. The idea of elements in obvious if one considers a bridge: To model various designs, one can consider the trusses to be the finite elements that have, for example, elastic properties. The elements are meshed and the PDEs (what exactly they are depends on the problem at hand) are then solved numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase field:** In the case of phase field models, the space is typically discretized using a regular grid and the relevant PDEs are solved using *finite differebce methods* on a grid. The PDEs arise from the physical proprties of the system: The system is described by an *order parameter*. The order parameter is a central concept in fields such as *physical chemistry* and *condensed matter physics* and it describes the emergence of order in a system. In the disorder state (high temperature), the order paramater is zero. When the system undergoes a phase transition (temperature is lowered), the order parameter becomes small and finite, and it is bounded from above to the value of one. Thus, order parameter of one describes full order. The difficulty is that there is no unique way of determining the order parameter but its choice depends on the system. One thus needs deep knowledge of ths system and its behavior. Examples of order parameter are the density in the case of a liquid-gas transition and the wavefunction in the case of superconductivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Lattice-Boltzmann:** In this case the space is again meshed using a regular mesh. Then a fluid is described a density at each of the nodes. The idea is to then solve for the density and flow by approximating the Boltzmann transport equation. The simplest single-relaxation time approx to Bolzmann transport equation is the so-called Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation and it is commonly used in LB.  This method can be hybridized with particle models. \n",

    "         Figure: Quantum. The systems are described by the Schrödinger equation and wave functions. In classical molecular dynamics, there are no electrons.  Individual atoms are the smallest single entity. Molecules such as water do have properties such partial charges. Their dynamics is generated by Newton's equations of motion. In coarse-graned MD, atoms can be considered as 'bundled' such that a cluster of atoms forms a 'superatom' or a coarse-grained bead. In lattice-Boltzmann simulations, computation is done on a grid and atoms can be included as coarse-grained composite entities. In phase field models, there are no individual atoms. Instead, density is used. Finally, the finite element method (FEM) uses elements that typically have elastic (and other properties). \n",

    "## Why do we need so many methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples and discussion are mostly from computational chemistry / physics / chemical engineering. Even when restricted to those fields and just simulations, the number of methods is very large - and we haven't even talked about algorithms and data analysis yet! Why do we need some many methods? There are various reasons, so let's take a look at some. First, let's look at the number of atoms/components - after all, in the context of computational chemistry / physics / chemical engineering they are fundamental units. Analogously, in other problems one has to identify the basic units and behaviours to be modelled and analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical classical MD simulation has 10,000-100,000 atoms. The atoms are treated as entities interacting via pair potentials, and electrons (or nuclei) are not taken into account separately. Without considering technical details, let's naively assume that that there is some relatively straightforward way of treating electrons and nuclei. A system of 10,000 atoms would then contain many more entities. If the system has only hydrogens, then the total number of particles would be 20,000. Let's consider carbon-12. It has 6 protons, 6 neutrons and 6 electrons: Each atom has 18 smaller entities. This would make the 10,000 atom system to a 180,000 atom system. How about gold? It has 79 protons, 118 neutrons and 79 electrons. This means that each Au atom has 276 smaller entities and a system of 10,000 atoms would then consist of 2,760,000 particles. The number alone is overwhelming and the methods to treat them make it an even tougher problem. Here are some issues that one needs to consider. \n",

    "## Programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "One typical question is: Does one need to be able to program? The simple answer is yes. One needs to know some programming independent if one does computation, theory or experiments. Below is a brief discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which programming language should I use/learn?** Depends on the needs, the level of knowledge and application(s). For example, Python is a general purpose language that can be used for many purposes and it is particularly useful for analyzing and visualzing data indpendent if the data is from simulations, experiments or some database. Python is very quick to learn and it has amazing amount of libraries and routines for almost any imaginable task, and the community is large and very supportive. Python is an interpreted language. Python is a language that has become a must learn independent of field and application, and it is particularly important in machine learning. We will also use Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "C and C++ have a different nature than Python. They have to be compiled and they have a much more rigidily defined structure. C/C++ codes are great for writing high-performance simulation codes and, for example in the field of molecular simulations, Gromacs, LAMMPS and NAMD are written in C/C++. As for syntax, C/C++ and Python have lots of similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortran is an older programming language and it was originally designed to be very efficient for numerical calculations. The name Fortran comes from *For*mula *Tran*slation. Although there has been a shift to C/C++, many HPC codes such as CP2K, Orca and Gaussian are written in Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphics processing units (GPU) are used increasingly in high performance computing. They use languages such as CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs, HIP for AMD GPUs and OpenCL that is GPU agnostic. In high performance computing CUDA is the dominant one while HIP is starting to gain ground. Syntactically, they have a very high resemblance to C/C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for computers,  the Linux operating system is the dominant in the world of higher performance computing. As for programming, it can be done in any of the common environments, that is, Windows, Mac OSX and Linux, or even Android or Chrome."
