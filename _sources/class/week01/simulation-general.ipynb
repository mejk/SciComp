How do we deal with interactions? They need to be truncated but what is the most reliable way to do it? Does the system have long-range interactions? If so, do we wish to use Fourier transform-based algorithms or real space ones? In either case, there are several choises that one needs to understand. If we are writing out own code, we need to decide how to speed up the simulations - normal MD scales as $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ where $N$ is the number of particles (the so-called [big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) notation is used to express how well algorithms scale).

The software will run, but there is no guarantee that the results will be correct if one doesn't understand the inputs and outputs. In addtion, the results will not be relevant (even if correct) if one doesn't have a good research question. Reproducing data is not research. The software is not to blame for any of those matters, it does what the user tells it do. The user is the source of most errors; even if/when there is a bug/are bugs (and there are always are some), it is the user's responsibility to test and ensure the validity of results.
