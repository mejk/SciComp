    "\n",
    "Advanced undergraduate students in Chemistry. This course should also be of interest for students in Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemical Engineering, Pharmaceutical Science, and related, interested in computational modeling, molecular visualization and data analysis. In addition to students working in computational modeling, the course is useful for anyone interested in  practical aspects of modern simulations. The data analysis and visualization parts are also applicable to analysis / visualization of experimental data.\n",

    "1. Installation of Gromacs (version 2018.6) is required. This means: either the ability to install it on your own personal laptop or having access to Gromacs otherwise (that access must be available during labs). For installation on your own computer: Works easily if your operating system is either Windows 10, Linux, or OSX. Detailed instructions will be provided during the first lecture / labs. About Gromacs: Gromacs is one of the world’s most popular and fastest molecular simulation software and available freely (open source) at www.gromacs.org\n",
    "\n",
    "2. VMD. VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is a powerful tool for analysis and visualization of molecules. It is freely available at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/. VMD is available for all common operating systems (Linux, Windows, OSX).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Python installation. Some python programming is included in the course. Python is available for all common operating systems at www.python.org\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Plotting program like grace, gnuplot, Matlab, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software that needs to be installed on your computer during this course\n",

    "\n",
    "- Linux (unless you have a Mac)\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- Jupyter Lab/Notebook\n",
    "- Gromacs version xx.xx. Gromacs is a state-of-the-art simulation package and it will be used throughout the course.\n",
    "  - Gromacs has some requirements including a c/c++ compiler, cmake and so on. We will discuss all these details when we discuss Gromacss.\n",
    "- VMD - Visual Molecular Dynamics. It is freely available at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/ for all common operating systems (Linux, Windows, OSX).\n",

    "For the purposes of this course pretty much any reasonable modern computer is fine. Say, if your computer is able to run Windows 10, it will work. What will be needed, however, is an installation of Linux. If you are a Mac users, you don't need necessarily to do that since you already have a CLI but you need to pay some extra attention to some of the commands since there are some differences beween Linux and Mac terminals. In particular, Linux uses the bash shell and Mac uses zsh.\n",

    "- If you have a discrete NVIDIA GPU, you will be able to use it for running simulations *provided* you have either pure Linux or dual boot. This will be discussed when we discuss Linux and software installation.\n",
    "- You will need some storage space. 10 GB should be more than enough.  \n",

    "## Topics to be covered\n",

The course provides a broad overview of the common methods in the framework of molecular modeling and, importantly, how to relate the data to experiments. Simulations of proteins, lipid bilayers and solvation of organic molecules will be performed. The course will be a balanced treatment of modeling, data analysis, visualization and relation to experimentally observable / measurable phenomena. "
