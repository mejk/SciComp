## Installation

- [Instructions for both Jupyter Lab and Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html)


This is the recommended method for best performance.

    Install: To run your own software, it is recommended that you download and install the Anaconda package, which includes everything you will need. Click either Windows, Mac or Linux, then download and launch the installer for Anaconda Python 3.x. Be patient, this can take many minutes.

    Start Jupyter: After installation, find the Anaconda Navigator and start it. From the Navigator, click Jupyter Lab. You will know it’s working if a new tab (labeled “Home”) opens in your web browser.
    Make a notebook: When Jupyter starts, the “launcher” will open in a tab of your default web browser. From there you may start a new notebook: under Notebook click Python 3. You should see the prompt In [1]: at the top of the working area of the notebook.
        Enter something simple, like 1+1 and then shift-enter to execute the code.
        To create a text box, find the menu that says Code and change it to Markdown. Enter some text and hit shift-enter to display it. (Markdown is a simple way to format text, which you can learn more about at your convenience).
    Edit a notebook: You will probably want to edit an existing notebook. You will need to download notebook to your computer.
        You might want to download the ipy intro
        You could check out an notebook from the gallery of interesting notebooks.
        Find and save the notebook (.ipynb) file you are interested in. You can, for example, right-click (control-click on macs) on this link and save the file.
        Locate the new notebook file on your computer (possibly in the Downloads folder), then drag and drop it onto the file list at the left. Double-click the name of the notebook in the file list to begin working.
        Be sure to save your work.

    Learn more: Learn how to save and share notebooks, and how to do more complicated computations. You might start with Archie’s IPy Intro. There are many resources available for learning the Python language and the IPython environment — many of them to be found through those two links. Follow a tutorial if that is how you learn best. Most important, experiment and play with it. For specific questions, a simple google search is usually the best resource. (For example, how do you perform an inverse cosine? Just google “python inverse cosine”.)
