Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the 	code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

On two occasions I have been asked, "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?" ... I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

The laws of thermodynamics, as empirically determined, express the approximate and probable behavior of systems of a great number of particles, or, more precisely, they express the laws of mechanics for such systems as they appear to beings who have not the fineness of perception to enable them to appreciate quantities of the order of magnitude of those which relate to single particles, and who cannot repeat their experiments often enough to obtain any but the most probable results.

"Every attempt to employ mathematical methods in the study of chemical
questions must be considered profoundly irrational and contrary to the
spirit of chemistry.... if mathematical analysis should ever hold a
prominent place in chemistry - an aberration which is happily almost
impossible - it would occasion a rapid and widespread degeneration of that
science."
-Auguste Comte, Cours de philosophie positive, 1830

“All that glitters may not be gold, but at least it contains free electrons.”

Laplace (1819),
Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation.
Another interesting thought is due to Maxwell (1850):
The true logic of this world is the calculus of probabilities ...
