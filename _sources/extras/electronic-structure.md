Ab Initio TheoryBorn-Oppenheimer Approximation: Nuclei are heavier than electronsand can be considered stationary with respect to electrons. Also knowas "clamped nuclei" approximations and leads to idea of potentialsurfaceSlater Determinants: Expand the many electron wave function in termsof Slater determinants.Basis Sets: Represent Slater determinants by molecular orbitals, whichare linear combination of atomic-like-orbital functions i.e. basis sets


he potential energy surface (PES) is multi-dimensional (3N−6fornon-linear molecule and3N−5for linear molecule)The PES contains multiple minima and maxima.Geometry optimization search aims to find the global minimum of thepotential surface.Transition state or saddle point search aims to find the maximum of thispotential surface, usually along the reaction coordinate of interest.

Geometry optimization is used to find minima on the potential energy surface, with theseminimum energy structures representing equilibrium structures.Optimization also is used to locate transition structures, which are represented by saddlepoints on the potential energy surface.Optimization to minima is also referred to as energy minimization.During minimization, the energy of molecules is reduced by adjusting atomic coordinates.Energy minimization is done when using either molecular mechanics or quantummechanics methods, and it must precede any computational analyses in which thesemethods are applied.For example, geometry optimization can be used to1characterize a potential energy surface2obtain a structure for a single-point quantum mechanical calculation, which providesa large set of structural and electronic properties3prepare a structure for molecular dynamics simulation - if the forces on atoms aretoo large, the integration algorithm may fail.These energies apply to molecules in a hypothetical motionless state at 0 K. Additionalinformation is needed to calculate enthalpies (e.g., thermal energies of translation,vibration, and rotation) and free energies (i.e., entropy)

ensity Functional Theory (DFT) is an alternative to wavefunction based electronicstructure methods of many-body systems such as Hartree-Fock and Post Hartree-Fock.In DFT, the ground state energy is expressed in terms of the total electron density.ρ0(r) =〈Ψ0|ˆρ|Ψ0〉We again start with Born-Oppenheimer approximation and write the electronic HamiltonianasˆH=ˆF+ˆVextwhereˆFis the sum of the kinetic energy of electrons and the electron-electron interactionandˆVextis some external potential

Pseudopotentials or Effective Core Potentials♦All Electron calculations are prohibitively expensive.♦Only valence electrons take part in bonding interaction leaving coreelectrons unaffected.♦Effective Core Potentials (ECP) a.k.a Pseudopotentials describeinteractions between the core and valence electrons.♦Only valence electrons explicitly described using basis sets.♦Pseudopotentials commonly usedLos Alamos National Laboratory: LanL1MB and LanL2DZStuttgard Dresden Pseudopotentials: SDDAll can be used.Stevens/Basch/Krauss ECP’s: CEP-4G,CEP-31G,CEP-121G♦Pseudopotential basis are "ALWAYS" read in pairsBasis set for valence electronsParameters for core electrons
